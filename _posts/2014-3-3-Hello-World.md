title: Welcome to my page! I'm new to GitHub. I'm interested in how the U.S. Government engages with foreign publics.

Below is an igraph that shows the number of retweets based upon the Twitter account of the U.S. Department of State, @StateDept (n = 1,000).

Next, we have an igraph that shows the number of retweets based upon the keywords "foreign public dialogue" (n = 100).

Note: both igraphs were produced in R using data generated by the API method.

Below are links to two CSV files that contain Twitter data (e.g., tweets, retweets, favorites, and frequency of users). The first CSV file is comprised of data based on the Twitter handle, @USEmbassyBKK (the U.S. embassy in Bangkok). The data cover November 1, 2019, to March 6, 2020. The second CSV file is based on a query of the keywords, "embassy dialogue." The data cover January 2, 2019, to January 15, 2020.

[Data by query](https://github.com/MarcusMMS/marcusmms.github.io/blob/master/Query%20-%20Embassydialogue.csv)

We also have an Excel file below that visualizes the Twitter data for the first aforementioned CSV file.

Next, we have plots to visualize the Twitter data of the second aforementioned CSV file.
