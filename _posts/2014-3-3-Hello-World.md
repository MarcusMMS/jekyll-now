title: Welcome to my page! I'm new to GitHub. I'm interested in how the U.S. engages with foreign publics.

Below is an igraph that shows the number of retweets based upon the Twitter account of the U.S. Department of State (n = 1,000).

Next, we have an igraph that shows the number of retweets based upon the keywords, "foreign public dialogue" (n = 100).

Below are links to two CSV files that contain Twitter data (e.g., tweets, retweets, favorites, and frequency of users). The first CSV file is comprised of data based on the Twitter handle, @USEmbassyBKK (the U.S. embassy in Bangkok). The data cover November 1, 2019, to March 6, 2020. The second CSV file is based on a query of the keywords, "embassy dialogue." The data cover January 2, 2019, to January 15, 2020.

[Data by query](https://github.com/MarcusMMS/marcusmms.github.io/blob/master/Query%20-%20Embassydialogue.csv)

We also have an Excel file that visualizes the Twitter data for the first aforementioned CSV file, and after that, we have a summary output of the data from R based on both CSV files.
