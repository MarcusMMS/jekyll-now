title: Welcome to my page! I'm new to GitHub. I'm interested in how the U.S. Government engages with foreign publics.

Below is an igraph that shows the number of retweets based upon the Twitter account of the U.S. Department of State, @StateDept (n = 1,000).

Next, we have an igraph that shows the number of retweets based upon the keywords "foreign public dialogue" (n = 100).

Note: both igraphs were produced in R using data generated by the API method.

Below are links to two CSV files that contain Twitter data (e.g., tweets, retweets, favorites, and frequency of users). The first CSV file is comprised of data based on the Twitter handle, @USEmbassyBKK (the U.S. embassy in Bangkok). The data cover November 1, 2019, to March 6, 2020. The second CSV file is based on a query of the keywords, "embassy dialogue." The data cover January 2, 2019, to January 15, 2020.

[Data by username](https://github.com/MarcusMMS/marcusmms.github.io/blob/master/Username%20-%20USEmbassyBKK.csv)

[Data by query](https://github.com/MarcusMMS/marcusmms.github.io/blob/master/Query%20-%20Embassydialogue.csv)

We also have an Excel file below that visualizes the Twitter data for the first aforementioned CSV file.

[USEmbassyBKK Twitter visualization](https://github.com/MarcusMMS/marcusmms.github.io/blob/master/_posts/Visualize%202.xlsx)

Next, we have plots to visualize the Twitter data of the second aforementioned CSV file.

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcusMMS/marcusmms.github.io/master/Retweets.png)

Total retweets = 2537

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcusMMS/marcusmms.github.io/master/Replies.png)

Total replies = 876

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcusMMS/marcusmms.github.io/master/Favorites.png)

Total favorites = 8246

![image](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MarcusMMS/marcusmms.github.io/master/Mentions.png)

Total mentions = 881

Note: the above plots were produced in R using data generated by the non-API method.

6. 1. FUNCTIONS

#Build a function that can take numbers that we pass through it and check if they're even (and, if they're even, store them in a list).

#Original code:
def isEven(num): 
    if num % 2 == 0: 
        even_numbers.append(num) #Note: this code will be changed to reflect the name of my list.
        return("This number is even. I'll add it to the list.") 
    else:
        return("This number is odd.") 


#Note: my code is...
Numbers = [5, 4, 3] #Note: creates my list.
def isEven(num): #Note: defines the function and provides for the entering of any number in the "num" placeholder.
    if num % 2 == 0: #Note: if a number divided by 2 has no reminder, it is even.
        Numbers.append(num) #Note: this adds whatever even number I enter later to my "Numbers" list.
        return("This number is even. I'll add it to the list.") #Note: returns a statement based upon the outcome of the function.
    else:
        return("This number is odd.") #Note: returns a statement based upon the outcome of the function.

#Try:
#isEven(2)
#This number is even. I'll add it to the list."
#Numbers
#[5, 4, 3, 2]


# Additional exercise
# 1. Create an odd number function.
def isOdd(num):
    if num % 2 !=0: #Note: if a number divided by 2 has a reminder, it is odd.
        return("This number is odd. I'll add it to the list.")
    else:
        return("This number is even.")

#Try:
#isOdd(2) will return: "This number is even."
#isOdd(5) will return: "This number is odd. I'll add it to the list."
    
# 2. Use the input function to prompt users to enter an integer for the 
#    computer to decide it is odd or even number.

#Note: the code is...
num = int(input("Any number: ")) #Note: enter this line first.
Enter a number: 2 #Note: this prompt appears after running the above line of code and you can put in any number.
   if (num % 2) == 0: #Note: if a number divided by 2 has no reminder, it is even.
	print("{0} is even".format(num))
else:
	print("{0} is odd".format(num))


#Note: output is that 2 is even.

#To check an odd number...
num = int(input("Any number: ")) #Note: enter this line first.
Any number: 7 #Note: this prompt appears after running the above line of code and you can put in any number.
   if (num % 2) !=0: #Note: if a number divided by 2 has a reminder, it is odd.
	print("{0} is odd".format(num))
else:
	print("{0} is even".format(num))

	
#Note: output is that 7 is odd.


"""
EXERCISE:
Create a function for checking whether or not I like various ingredients on a pizza, and return the results as a
string. As part of your checking, you should also check to see if the input is
actually a string or not.

topping_list = ["cheese", "pepperoni", "sausage", "bacon", "anchovies",
                "salami", "chorizo", "ham", "jalapenos", "pineapple",
                "olives", "tomatoes"]

#Note: the code is...
def isPizza(toppings):
    if toppings in ["cheese", "pepperoni", "sausage", "bacon", "anchovies",
                "salami", "chorizo", "ham", "jalapenos", "pineapple",
                "olives", "tomatoes"]: 
        return("I like this topping.")
    else:
        return("I don't like this topping.")

#Try:
#isPizza("beans") will return: "I don't like this topping."
#isPizza("cheese") will return: "I like this topping."
